\abstract{Instagram's API service provides access to interesting information about the relationships between users and their media. A visualization of this information would be beneficial to users who would like to get a "big picture" idea of how other users are interacting with their profile. The visualization would primarily help users discover different demographics within their follower base, but it could also help see what kinds of photos generated new users, and whether or not certain subgroups of users tend to interact more with certain kinds of media. We believe this visualization could be built utilizing modern web technologies.%

Instagram began as a simple photo sharing application, but it has grown into a social media giant. Companies use it to market their products, individuals use it to tell stories and share what they enjoy, and groups of individuals can use it as a platform to share pictures privately. 

On top of the media, the application allows users to like and comment on photos, and the data underneath that system can shed some insight on a profile is being interacted with, which can be used to improve the profile's effectiveness. This data is not easily visualized mentally, due primarily to the sheer size of the relationships.

Users who want to see how other users are interacting with their profile would benefit from a visualization of this information. We suggest that a visualization utilizing spacial recognition and relative size can effectively portray this information in a way that is beneficial to the previously mentioned users.

\section{Visualization Tasks}

This visualization is intended to solve problems regarding the relationship between the primary user and users who have interacted with their profile. These problems include:
\begin{itemize}
\item How can I tell if there are multiple demographics interacting with my profile?
\item Is there a certain subset of users that seem to like specific photos?
\item Which of my photos helped to generate new followers?
\end{itemize}


\section{Data Sources}
The primary resource for fetching data comes from the Instagram API, which is described by the official documentation. From this API, we have access to endpoints with data about a user's profile, their media, and attributes about that media such as who liked the media and who commented on it ("Instagram Developer Documentation").

\section{ER Diagrams}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{erd}

\section{Implementation of ER diagrams}
The data itself is already implemented in Instagram's API service. What we suggest is to pull from the API dynamically, formatting the data during runtime for the visualization.

\section{Visualization Interface Design}
The visualization itself is going to look similar to a force-directed graph with two kinds of nodes. The primary nodes represent a Media object. These are photos or videos, and they will display the photo or a screen shot of the video. Secondary nodes will represent User populations related to primary nodes, displaying the number of users being represented in that node.

If one user has liked a media object, a secondary node is created and attached to the media node. As the number of users increases who liked the same media object, the scale of the secondary node increases.

The interface will include one secondary node for every combination of users and specific photos they liked or commented on. For example, two users who liked two of the three media nodes will get a separate node from a user who has interacted with all three media nodes.
